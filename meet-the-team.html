                We created Companion after witnessing firsthand the challenges of managing elder care within our own families. As immigrants and 
                refugees from Vietnam, our families faced unique struggles in navigating healthcare systems, making it even more difficult to coordinate 
                care for our elders. Our team saw how complex healthcare management could be, and we set out to build a solution that simplifies task management, 
                communication, and workflow tracking. With Companion, our goal is to make caregiving more organized and efficient—so those providing care can focus on what truly matters.

               Hoang Anh Vu is a student at Boston University, currently double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. His passion 
               for Computer Science is fueled by his love for coding, while his interest in Psychology stems from a desire to better understand human behavior. 
               Recognizing the importance of making senior management better, while also aligning with his academic interests, he decided to join forces in the projects. 
               Beyond academics, he enjoys playing video games, playing with the piano despite not being particularly skilled, watching movies, and learning many disciplines 
               from science to history.

               Brandon is an avid basketballer pursuing a major in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
               He was inspired by his time volunteering at his local hospice center after witnessing the disorganized workflows of managing volunteers and 
               seniors. Some of his favorite memories include reading and writing to seniors and often times, playing board games with them. Brandon is 
               motivated by the impact that he can have on others, and hopes to leverage technology to achieve this.
