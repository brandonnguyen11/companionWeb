               Brandon is an avid basketballer pursuing a major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 
               He was inspired by his time volunteering at his local hospice center after witnessing the disorganized workflows of managing volunteers and 
               seniors. Some of his favorite memories include reading and writing to seniors and often times, playing board games with them. Brandon is 
               motivated by the impact that he can have on others, and hopes to leverage technology to achieve this.
