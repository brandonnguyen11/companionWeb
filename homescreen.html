          <div class="paragraph1">
            Companion was born out of necessity. As a team of university students, we faced a challenge that hit close to home—helping our families manage 
            their elders' care. We saw firsthand how difficult it was to coordinate healthcare tasks, track responsibilities, and ensure communication among
             caregivers and family members.
          </div>
            
          <div class="paragraph1">
            Through trial and error, we discovered that simplifying task management and workflow tracking made a difference. What started as a solution for
             our loved ones quickly grew into something bigger—an app designed to empower families, caregivers, and healthcare professionals alike. With 
             Companion, we aim to bridge the gap between care and coordination, making it easier to provide the support that truly matters.

          <div class="paragraph1">
            At Companion, our mission is to revolutionize healthcare management by streamlining communication, task delegation, and workflow organization. 
            We believe that no one should struggle to provide care due to disorganized processes.
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph1">
            Our goal is to make caregiving simpler and more efficient—whether you're a family member managing a loved one's needs, a healthcare worker coordinating 
            patient care, or a professional overseeing a team. By bringing clarity and structure to healthcare management, Companion helps ensure that the people who 
            matter most get the care they deserve.
